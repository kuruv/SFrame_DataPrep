# SFrame Data Preparation

Preparing data for machine learning using SFrame

I have started this to store and share python code modules for preparing data for building models.

Currently, I am using [XGBoost] (github.com/dmlc/xgboost) for most of my needs and it requires numerical input. I have used [SFrame] (github.com/turi-code/SFrame) for generating one hot encoded variables for catgorical variables and their final output to a CSV.
